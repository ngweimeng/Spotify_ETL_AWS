# Spotify ETL Pipeline using Python and AWS

## Overview

//

## Project Goals
1. Data Ingestion — Build a mechanism to ingest data from different sources
2. ETL System — We are getting data in raw format, transforming this data into the proper format
//

## Services we will be using
1. Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that provides manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
2. AWS IAM: This is nothing but identity and access management which enables us to manage access to AWS services and resources securely.
3. QuickSight: Amazon QuickSight is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.
4. AWS Glue: A serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
5. AWS Lambda: Lambda is a computing service that allows programmers to run code without creating or managing servers.
6. AWS Athena: Athena is an interactive query service for S3 in which there is no need to load data it stays in S3.
